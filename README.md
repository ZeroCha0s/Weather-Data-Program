# Weather-Data-Program

This weather data program is a project that was created during my time in CEIS-110 class in university. 

The project thatâ€™s being presented is a system that contributes to information that you provide to the database in order to gather weather conditions and temperature.

The following software that was used was Spyder, SQLite Studio, and Microsoft Excel.
